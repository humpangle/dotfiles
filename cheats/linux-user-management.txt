user management in linux
$ sudo useradd new_user
		create new user -
	  user home directory will not be created i.e no /home/user_name
	  user can not log in

  	if you now need the user to be able to login
$ sudo passwd new_user

2. create user, user home directory and user can log in
$ sudo useradd -m new_user -p user_password

3. add group
$ sudo groupadd new_goup

4. add user to group
$ sudo usermod -aG groupname username # -a = appending -G = to group

5. make group active in current shell:
$ newgrp groupname # to make permanent, you need to logout and log back in

6. list all groups
$ groups

file and directory permissions
-----------------------------------------------
permission is written in the sequence: rwx === read,write,execute

oexample when you execute `ls path_name`:
drwxr-xr-x  3 kanmii kanmii 4,0K Mär  5 21:04 .hex
  drwxr-xr-x  === owner-group-public permissions.
  d == it's a directory.
  drwxr === kanmii (owner) can read, write and execute directory
  -xr === kanmii (group) can only execute and read (- === no write permission)
  -x === public can only execute (- === no read/write)

-rw-r--r--  1 root   root     56 Mär 28 10:33 000.txt
  -rw === it's a file. owner (root) can read/write (- === it's a file)
  -r- === group (root) can only read
  -r-- === others can only read.

                    change permission
