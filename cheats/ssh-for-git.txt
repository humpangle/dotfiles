# humpangle github.com
Host github.com-humpangle
   HostName github.com
   User git

url = git@github.com-humpangle:humpangle/hacker_rank.git
the format is git@<ssh host = github.com-humpangle in this case>:<github userame = humpangle in this example>/<repo name on github - hacker_rank in this case>.git

5. Registering the new SSH Keys with the ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github_humpangle
